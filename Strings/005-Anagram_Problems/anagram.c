/*
 * Program: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
 * Write a function to check if two strings are valid anagrams of each other without using built-in sort functions.
 * 
 * Concept:
 * Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase,
 * using all the original letters exactly once. For two strings to be anagrams:
 * 
 * 1. They must contain the same characters in the same quantity.
 * 2. They can differ in the order of characters.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - "listen" and "silent" are anagrams because they contain the same letters (l, i, s, t, e, n),
 *   just arranged differently.
 * - "triangle" and "integral" are also anagrams for the same reason.
 * 
 * Non-Examples:
 * - "hello" and "world" are not anagrams because they donâ€™t contain the same characters.
 * - "cat" and "acts" are also not anagrams because "acts" has an extra 's'.
 * 
 * Anagrams are commonly used in puzzles, cryptography, and word games.
 * 
 * Return Values:
 * The function `areAnagrams` is designed to return an integer:
 * - return 0 generally means success (true), indicating that the two strings are anagrams.
 * - return 1 means failure (false), indicating that the two strings are not anagrams.
 * 
 * This approach keeps the function in line with standard programming practices, where:
 * - true signifies a successful condition (anagrams),
 * - false signifies an unsuccessful condition (not anagrams).
