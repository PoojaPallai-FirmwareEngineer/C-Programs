// Interpolation search is an efficient search algorithm for finding a value in a sorted array.
// It works similarly to binary search, but instead of dividing the search range in half,
// it uses a mathematical formula to estimate the position of the key based on the value being searched for.

// How Interpolation Search Works:
// The idea is based on the assumption that values are uniformly distributed across the array.
// If the values are more densely packed in certain areas, this search algorithm can 
// potentially offer better performance than binary search.

// The formula used to estimate the position pos is:
// pos = low + ( (key - arr[low]) * (high - low) ) / (arr[high] - arr[low])

// Where:
// 'low' and 'high' are the indices of the current search range.
// 'arr[low]' and 'arr[high]' are the values at the low and high indices, respectively.
// 'key' is the value we are searching for.

// Steps Involved:
// 1. Start with the whole array: The search starts with the range from low = 0 to high = n-1, 
//    where n is the length of the array.
// 2. Calculate the probe position: Using the interpolation formula, calculate the position 'pos'
//    where the key might be located.
// 3. Compare the value at 'pos' with the key:
//    - If arr[pos] == key, weâ€™ve found the key and return its position.
//    - If arr[pos] < key, the key is likely in the right half of the array, 
//      so update low = pos + 1 to narrow the search range to the right.
//    - If arr[pos] > key, the key is likely in the left half of the array, 
//      so update high = pos - 1 to narrow the search range to the left.
// 4. Repeat the process: Continue recalculating the probe position and adjusting the search 
//    range until the key is found or the search range is exhausted (i.e., low > high).
