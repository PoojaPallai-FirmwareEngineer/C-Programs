# Sorting Programs in C

This document provides a categorized list of various sorting programs implemented in C. It includes sorting tasks for different data structures and advanced concepts.

## String Sorting
1. Sort an array of strings alphabetically
2. Sort characters of a single string alphabetically
3. Sort a string array in descending order and aescending order
4. Case-insensitive sorting of strings
5. Sort strings by length

## Character Sorting
6. Sort an array of characters (e.g., A-Z or a-z)
7. Sort characters in a single string alphabetically
8. Sort characters in a string ignoring case

## Array/Matrix Sorting
9. Sort a 2D matrix row-wise
10. Sort a 2D matrix column-wise
11. Sort a jagged array row-wise

## Hybrid and Specialized Sorting
12. Sort integers with only positive numbers
13. Sort integers with negative and positive numbers
14. Sort an array with duplicate elements
15. Sort an array with unique elements only
- Sort a partially sorted array (nearly sorted) (After heap sort)
- Sort a rotated sorted array

## Custom Data Types Sorting
18. Sort an array of structures (e.g., students by marks, employees by salary)
19. Sort a linked list (ascending/descending)
20. Sort a doubly linked list
21. Sort a circular linked list

## Theory question
1. Sort using a custom comparator function 
2. Sort using Divide and Conquer
3. Stable vs. Unstable sorting (implement examples)
4. Comparison-based sorting vs. Non-comparison-based sorting
5. Sort a large dataset using external sorting (file-based sorting)
